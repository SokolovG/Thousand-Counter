    "rulesContent": "Rules of the card game \"Thousand\":\n\n1. Bolt\nIf a player takes no tricks during a round, they receive a \"bolt\" (displayed as a dash in the game results). If a player accumulates three bolts during the game, 120 points are deducted from their score, the bolts are annulled, and the procedure repeats if they get three bolts again.\n\n2. Bidding\nAfter cards are dealt, players evaluate their hands to determine how many points they can take. Then they declare their bids.\nA bid is a declaration of the number of points a player commits to taking in the current round.\nBidding starts immediately after dealing. The player with the first bid right is obligated to bid at least 100 points.\nPlayers then take turns bidding or passing (using the \"pass\" button). If a player passes, they cannot participate in further bidding for that round.\nBidding proceeds in increments of 5 points. The winner of the auction gets the first move and is obligated to take at least the declared amount of points during the round. If successful, the declared points are added to their score; otherwise, the sum is deducted.\nThe widow (priukup) is not revealed if there was no bidding war (i.e., someone bid the mandatory 100 and others passed). The player who won the bidding takes the widow and orders the game (declares the final bid).\n\n3. Bidding Constraints\nThere are rules limiting the points a player can bid:\n• A player cannot bid more than 120 points without a marriage in hand;\n• A player cannot bid more than 160 points with only a Spade marriage;\n• A player cannot bid more than 180 points with only a Club marriage;\n• A player cannot bid more than 200 points with only a Diamond marriage;\n• A player cannot bid more than 220 points with only a Heart marriage.\n\nIf possessing two or more marriages, the limit increases by the sum of their values.\n\n4. Gameplay\nThe winner of the auction leads first. Other players must follow suit (if void, play a trump; if void in trumps, play any card). The player with the highest card takes the trick and leads next. The player with the lead can declare a marriage.\nAt the end of the round, points are calculated: tricks plus declared marriages. If the auction winner made their contract, the points are added; if not, deducted. Other players receive the points they collected.\n\n5. Scoring\nPoints are counted based on card values. The sum is rounded to the nearest 5 (down for 2, up for 3).\nExample: 17 points = 15; 18 points = 20.\nThis rounding rule does not apply to the auction winner - if they are short even by 1 point from their bid, their score is not counted (contract failed).\nThe value of declared marriages is added to the points from tricks.\n\n6. \"Barrel\" Rules\nIf a player reaches 880 points, they sit on the \"barrel\".\nTo win, the player on the barrel must reach 1000 points (effectively taking 120 points). A marriage is not strictly required if the hand is a \"lay down\" (non-beatable) that collects all tricks (summing 120).\nThe player on the barrel has three attempts to reach the winning score. If they fail after three rounds, they fall off the barrel (score reduced by 120) and must climb back up (reach 880 again).\nOnly one player can be on the barrel at a time. If another player climbs onto the barrel, the first one falls off (penalty 120).",
